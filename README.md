## 📌 Overview  
This repository provides a **structured, reusable prompt engineering template** for Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It enables **transparent chain-of-thought reasoning** while embedding context from **leading African tech-driven cities** such as Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt (Nigeria) and Accra, Kumasi (Ghana).  

The template is:  
- **Structured** – step-by-step reasoning.  
- **Contextualized** – grounded in African urban/tech realities.  
- **Fluid** – adaptable across tasks and audiences.  
- **Self-checking** – includes a review step to improve quality.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
This template guides LLMs through reasoning while:  
- Embedding African context for realism.  
- Adapting outputs for both technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Ensuring reliability with a built-in self-review loop.  

---

## 🛠️ How to Use  
1. Open `template.md`.  
2. Fill in the parameters (task, audience, depth, etc.).  
3. Paste the template into your LLM environment.  
4. Run with your specific input.  
5. Review output and adapt as needed.

## 💡 Example  

**Input:**  
Task: Design a smart transport solution for improving commuting.
Audience: mixed
Depth: standard
Output format: markdown
Cities focus: Lagos, Accra
Constraints: limited electricity
Evidence required: yes


**Output (excerpt):**  
1. Restate → "We are designing a smart transport solution for African cities."  
2. Context → "Lagos and Accra face congestion, unstable electricity, and fragmented transport..."  
3. Approaches →  
   - Option A: IoT-enabled traffic lights + GPS bus tracking.  
   - Option B: Ride-hailing + commuter apps.  
4. Evaluation → "IoT requires reliable electricity; ride-hailing leverages mobile penetration but faces regulatory hurdles."  
5. Conclusion → **"A hybrid approach combining ride-hailing data with optimized bus scheduling is most feasible."**
