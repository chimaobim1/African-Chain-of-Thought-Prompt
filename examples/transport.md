# üöç Example: Transport Planning Prompt

**Input:**  
Task: Design a smart transport solution for improving commuting.
Audience: mixed
Depth: standard
Output format: markdown
Cities focus: Lagos, Accra
Constraints: limited electricity
Evidence required: yes


**Output (structured):**  
1. Restate ‚Üí "We are designing a smart transport solution for African cities."  
2. Context ‚Üí "Lagos and Accra face heavy traffic, unreliable electricity, and fragmented public transport. Internet use is widespread but data integration is weak."  
3. Approaches ‚Üí  
   - Option A: IoT traffic lights + GPS bus tracking.  
   - Option B: Ride-hailing + commuter mobile apps.  
4. Evaluation ‚Üí  
   - IoT requires stable electricity.  
   - Ride-hailing leverages existing infrastructure but faces regulation.  
5. Conclusion ‚Üí **"Hybrid model combining ride-hailing data with optimized bus scheduling is the most feasible."**  
6. Audience Adaptation ‚Üí  
   - Technical: APIs for Lagos BRT + Accra metro bus.  
   - Non-technical: "An app that shows which bus will get you home faster."  
7. Self-review ‚Üí Context included, multiple options explored, final answer feasible.  
8. Extension ‚Üí Could be adapted to Nairobi or Johannesburg.
